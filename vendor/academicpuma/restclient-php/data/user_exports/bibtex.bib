  abstract = {Abstract. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are a fascinating branch of
computational intelligence with much potential for use in many application
areas. The fundamental principle of EAs is to use ideas inspired by the
biological mechanisms observed in nature, such as selection and genetic
changes, to find the best solution for a given optimization problem. Generally,
EAs use iterative processes, by growing a population of solutions selected in a
guided random search and using parallel processing, in order to achieve a
desired result. Such population based approaches, for example particle swarm
and ant colony optimization (inspired from biology), are among the most
popular metaheuristic methods being used in machine learning, along with
others such as the simulated annealing (inspired from thermodynamics). In this
paper, we provide a short survey on the state-of-the-art of EAs, beginning with
some background on the theory of evolution and contrasting the original ideas
of Darwin and Lamarck; we then continue with a discussion on the analogy
between biological and computational sciences, and briefly describe some
fundamentals of EAs, including the Genetic Algorithms, Genetic Programming,
Evolution Strategies, Swarm Intelligence Algorithms (i.e., Particle Swarm
Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, Bacteria Foraging Algorithms, Bees
Algorithm, Invasive Weed Optimization), Memetic Search, Differential
Evolution Search, Artificial Immune Systems, Gravitational Search Algorithm,
Intelligent Water Drops Algorithm. We conclude with a short description of the
usefulness of EAs for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining tasks and present
some open problems and challenges to further stimulate research.
